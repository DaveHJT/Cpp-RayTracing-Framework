# RayTracing-Project
A raytracing framework is written in C++, implemented reflection; refraction; texture mapping; mesh model; 360 background; motion blur, defocus blur (depth of field).

## Video Demo:

The full video demo is [here](https://github.com/DaveHJT/RayTracing-Project/blob/main/demo%20video.mp4).

## Document:
Please see the [document](https://github.com/DaveHJT/RayTracing-Project/blob/main/document.pdf) for details.

## Compilation:
1. This assignment is completed on the CS484 Virtual Machine.

2. Run the program by : 
premake4 gmake
make
/A4 Asset/video.lua

## Manual:
1. This program is based on the A4 framework so it runs the same as A4. After activation, the frames are generated in ./render folder.
