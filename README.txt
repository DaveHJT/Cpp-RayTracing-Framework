Compilation:
1. This assignment is completed on the CS484 Virtual Machine.

2. Run the program by : 
premake4 gmake
make
/A4 Asset/simple.lua

Manual:
1. I had some problem with hierarchical model so that simple-cow and macho-cow are not rendered, so I used hier and nonhier instead.
2. Other objectives are complete; bounding box and sample images are rendered.
3. Additional feature implemented is reflective surface. An additional parameter is added to gr.material at the end as the reflectivity.
4. Sample image is a beautiful sunset demonstrating the mirror surfaces.
